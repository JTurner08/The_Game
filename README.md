# The_Game
Rock paper Scissors is a classic game. The rules of the game are as follows. Rock beats scissors, but not paper. Scissors beats paper, but not rock. Paper beat rocks, but not scissors
of course if player/user throws the same hand as opponent then a draw occurs and you must try again.
In this project I will attempt to recreate the game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
